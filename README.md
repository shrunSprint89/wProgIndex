About project
------------------
This project is an open-source web application that will host a (possibly crowd-sourced) collection of the best web programming resources of all types, tagged and classified. 

Attempts to solve the problem of searching in different places to find the materials to learn that one is most comfortable with. This website lists resources in one place, a sort of index that people could refer to and also add things to.  

Architecture in short
------------------

MEAN stack used
Angular SPA as front-end (app_public folder)
REST API to serve data (app_api folder)
Express/Nodejs app acts as the server-side application and is encapsulates the Express REST API as well (app_server folder)

What's being worked on
------------------
Map view containing a mindmap of web programming knowledge, with links present in the map for easier learning
Better styling and background
