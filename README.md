## About project

This project is an open-source web application that aims to provide mapping and short notes about web technologies and various areas of web programming and also to provide a curated collection of very good resources to learn about various areas in web programming.

The application is aimed at software developers, web developers who want to get a birds eye view of web programming and also find links to great resources for learning. Also anyone looking to find short notes for revising your knowledge may find this website useful.

## Architecture in short

MEAN stack
Angular SPA as front-end (/app_public)
REST API to serve data (/app_api)
Express/Nodejs app acts as the server-side application and routes requests to the REST API as needed (/app_server)

#### Libraries used:
- [markmap](https://github.com/dundalek/markmap)
- [particles.js](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js)
