# WebResGuide

About project
------------------
This project is intented to be an open-source web application that will host a (possibly crowd-sourced) collection of the best web programming resources of all types, tagged and classified. 

During my efforts are improving my web programming knowledge, I had to search different places to find the best resources (or rather one could say the ones I felt most comfortable with) I could use to learn more and improve my skills.

And I wanted to create a project to showcase my skills also. Hence I hit upon the idea of creating a website that lists resources in one place, a sort of index that people could check out and also add things to.

I hope this would grow to become a learning experience for me and for others as well.

Surely, I have learn from others a lot of what I know and it would be right to help others too.

Contribution
------------------
This is yet to be done. No on else working on this for now.
